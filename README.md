In this data science and machine learning project, we classify sports personalities. We restrict classification to only 5 people:
  1. Elon Musk
  2. Mark Zuckerberg
  3. Priyanka Chopra
  4. Cristiano Ronaldo
  5. Virat Kohli

Here is the folder structure,
  UI : This contains ui website code
  server: Python flask server
  model: Contains python notebook for model building
  model_dataset: Dataset used for our model training
 
Technologies used in this project,
  Python
  Numpy and OpenCV for data cleaning
  Matplotlib & Seaborn for data visualization
  SVM for classification
  Sklearn for model building
  Jupyter notebook and visual studio code as IDE
  Python flask for http server
  HTML/CSS/Javascript for UI
