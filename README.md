In this data science and machine learning project, we classify sports personalities. We restrict classification to only 5 people:
  1. Elon Musk
  2. Mark Zuckerberg
  3. Priyanka Chopra
  4. Cristiano Ronaldo
  5. Virat Kohli

Here is the folder structure,
  1. UI : This contains ui website code
  2. server: Python flask server
  3. model: Contains python notebook for model building
  4. model_dataset: Dataset used for our model training
 
Technologies used in this project,
1. Python
2. Numpy and OpenCV for data cleaning
3. Matplotlib & Seaborn for data visualization
4. SVM for classification
5. Sklearn for model building
6. Jupyter notebook and visual studio code as IDE
7. Python flask for http server
8. HTML/CSS/Javascript for UI
